# Coffee Machine Project

This is a simple coffee machine simulation built in Python. The program allows users to select a type of coffee, inserts coins, and checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee) to make the drink. If the inserted money is sufficient, the program deducts resources and gives change if necessary. The machine also allows generating a report to check available resources.

## Features

- Support for **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino** drinks.
- Checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, and coffee) before making a drink.
- Handles coin insertion with **quarters**, **dimes**, **nickels**, and **pennies**.
- Returns change if more money is inserted than needed.
- Provides a **report** of resources and money collected.
- Option to turn off the machine by typing `off`.
